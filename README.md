#### For 1-5, please refer to https://www.easy2getfurniture.com/Freguently-Asked-Questions ep 62-1.html
1) ~~"no interest pay off option" found under the question "What Are My Payment Options?" There's no interest charged on a lease-purchase option; however, there's a cost of leasing.~~
2) ~~"We are required by law to charge sales tax for all interstate sales we make" under the "Sales Tax" section:
For purchases made through Progressive Leasing, the store isn't to charge sales tax.~~
3) ~~"90 Day Payment Option*" found on the Progressive Leasing advertisement in the sidebar:
We don't offer a 90-day Payment Option in CA.~~
4) "Financing" link found at the bottom of the page:

#### Please keep in mind that the store is also able to replace the FAQ section on this page with a link to our
FAQ page: https://progleasing.com/frequently-asked-questions/

6) ~~"90 Day Payment Option*" near the top of the page:
~~We don't offer a 90-day Payment Option in CA.~~
7) "Our approval is based on income and employment" found under the section labeled "No Credit
Needed":
Our approvals are based on several factors, and this process is proprietary to our application process.
We can't imply that any approval/approval limit is guaranteed.
8) "90-Day Payment option, discounted early buyout 90 days:" under "Simple Payment Plans":
We don't offer a 90-day Payment Option in CA, and we have an Early Buyout Option after the 90-day
Payment Option (3 Months in CA), not a discounted version of the 90-day option.
9) "Payments can be automatically withdrawn from your account:" found under "Simple Payment Plans:
This implies that the customer gets to choose before payments begin.
10) "See our Pre-Approval Matrix to get a free peek at what your payments may look like" under
"Simple Payment Plans":
We can't imply that any approval/approval limit is guaranteed.
11) "Once the item(s) has been paid in full, you own the product(s)." under the question "What is the
Progressive Lease-to-Own program?":
This can mislead since there's usually a cost of leasing included in the lease balance.

This contains unapproved requirements that the retailer isn't allowed to list.
13) "after the lease is executed" in answer to the question "Is there a processing fee for the Progressive
Leasing lease?":
This isn't clear. We don't require the initial payment when the contracts are created. We require it only
when it is e-signed.

Our customer service department is open on Sundays; however, this isn't a fact we proactively
advertise.
